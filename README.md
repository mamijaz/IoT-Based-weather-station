# IoT Based Weather Station

The Project goal is to design a IoT based Weather station to moniter Temperature, Pressure and Humidity data and send them to the cloude. The user in the other end should be able to visualize the Weather data of each weather station remotely. 

The Project uses fallowing sensores to aquire the weather data
 - BMP 180 (Temperature and Pressure)
 - DTH 21  (Temperature and Humidity)
 
 The Project uses the ardino as the controller while using ESP 8266 to send data to the Thingspeak cloude.
 The data is visualize using the android app written using Java in android SDK.
